## Greetings stranger, stay a while and listen... ðŸ§™

Hi, I'm Aaron.

I've been developing software of various kinds since 2006. My interests are
wide and varied and have included everything from microservices to system tools
and even numerical simulations (e.g.
[FEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method)).

### Things I like

In no particular order...

#### Programming Languages

Pick the right tool for the job:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Best used for building fast + reliable software.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Best used for prototyping, exploring data, scripting.
    - Also decent for structured programming when combined with type checkers ([mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/), [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype), [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), [pyre](https://pyre-check.org/)).
- [Go](https://go.dev/) - Best used for cloud ecosystems.
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) - Best for understanding existing operating systems and systems level programming. Also for cross-language interop.

#### Books

- *The Mythical Man Month* by Fred Brooks - A classic on why work estimates are hard and why blindly adding more people to a project is a bad idea.
- *The Goal* by Eliyahu M Goldratt - A teaching story about how to optimize businesses.
- *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford - *The Goal* but written for software developers.
- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck and Hyrum Wright - A fascinating look at how Google works, for those of us who have never worked there.

#### Games

- [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) - A game about building factories and process flows.
- [Diablo IV](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/) - Because I like clicking on things.
